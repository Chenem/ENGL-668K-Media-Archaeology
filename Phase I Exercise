There are six antique computers set up for you to experiment with at MITH. In this, Phase I of the Media Archaeology module, you will learn basic facts about the pedigree of each, figure out how to turn it on (not always obvious!), and perform a few simple tasks to get a feel for how it works. You will work individually for this first phase of the module, logging your activity with each machine via GitHub. (Feel free to ask a classmate for help if you’re genuinely stuck on something, but only after you’ve made an honest effort on your own.) 

For the second phase of the module (to be distributed) you will work in pairs or small groups, choosing one or two computers for a more detailed exploration which may involve building or making something with its original software, and/or doing deeper historical and analytical work. 

You will generally have access to the computers any time MITH is open to the public, which is Mon-Fri, 9-5. Feel free to contact me with any logistical or technical problems. Phase I of this module is due by October 27.

*** Safe Handling ***

Some of these computers are more than three and a half decades old! They built ‘em strong back then so you don’t have to handle them with kid gloves, but please do treat the hardware with respect. To that end:

•	Absolutely no food or drink on the tabletop.
•	Some of the plugs and connections holding everything together are loose or delicate. If a machine doesn’t turn on check that all of its components are snugly plugged and connected, and that there is power going to it. Use common sense to try troubleshooting.
•	Never force anything. If something doesn’t seem to want to work or go or bend or fit, leave it be and ask me.
•	Please keep fingers off of the recording surface of the diskettes. Also keep magnets away!
•	All of the computers except the two Macs can simply be switched off at any point (though you will lose your work unless it’s been saved to a disk). The Macs should always be shut down using the appropriate option under the “Special” heading of the home menu (top of screen).
•	When you turn a computer off, wait about 10 seconds before turning it back on.
•	Please neaten up the workspace around each computer when you finish. Return diskettes to sleeves and holders, stack any books in an orderly fashion, etc.
•	Above all: please remember to turn these computers OFF when you are done with them. Remember, the learning experience for everyone starts with figuring out how to turn them on! Moreover, they won’t go to “sleep” on their own, and whatever is left of their lifespan will be diminished if they are left running.

*** The Exercise ***

For each computer, answer the questions and perform the tasks indicated. Feel free to consult any reference sources you spot around MITH (check the spline!), and/or Wikipedia or other online sources.

Make some additional notes below about each machine as you go: What’s the most notable difference from a computer that you’re used to? Can this computer and its software do anything that your current computer cannot?

KAYPRO 4

•	What year was it made? 
•	What operating system does it run? 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard template. (You don’t need to save your document.)

APPLE IIe

•	What year was it made? 
•	What operating system does it run?

•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. (If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!)

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. What else is on this Mac?

Turn it on (you must figure out how). / with the volume button.
Play MineStorm. / done:-)
Try another cartridge. Why do you think the designer’s would have opted for the “vector” graphics? / In is much easier to control and follow, especially when there's no mouse. In addition it is possible that he/she wanted to be unique and "cool"; to attract customers.

AMIGA

•	What year was it made? / 1985
•	What operating system does it run? / 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?

Turn it on (you must figure out how) / the button on the left sideof the computer. 
Try the demos. / I inserted different disk but non of them worked... I asked Raff about that but he said he didn't know what's the problem and couldn't help me... 
What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). 
Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The Future Was Here. /done. I really liked to read about the "Desktop Video". It is very interesting to see how things have evolved since then. We have system which are programed to produce the same product, but are much more easier, fast and enables many other options to engage other methods into our product (a video clip). It also make me think about "stepping out of the box" and think totaly different rather than develop the same thing. I think theat the three dimensional printer is a good example for this kind of pioneering thinking (the discussion we had in our last class was also about that)

MACINTOSH IIci

•	What year was it made? 
  1989
•	What operating system does it run? 
  System 6.0.4-System 7.1.1(Pro), System 7.5-Mac OS 7.6.1
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
  Back then it costed $6269. Today it seems that it's not too hard to find one. You can find it on ebay and the price range is diverse. There is an open auction with starting bid price of $9.99. You can also find a computer which is not starting up at a price of $40 or a whole set (working!) in $150. 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?

Turn it on (you must figure out how) / the right key on the top
Open WordPerfect. Open MS Word. Try typing a simple document in each. / done
Which do you like better, and why? / I must edmitthat I couldn't find any significent difference. However I slighty prefer MS Word because the commends logos are closer in their look to the Word system we're using today.
Open MacPaint. Try drawing something. (You don’t need to save any of your work from these applications.) / done. 
What else is on this Mac? / I found the FileMaker which I'm not sure what it is exactly. It looks like the old version of Excel... a system to organize lists..
    I was surprized to find a Finder program. I thought is in an advanced tool (that was developed later), but it actualy works in this old-sweet computer..
What can you learn about its past user(s)? / She was minimalist and organized...
